Malicious software, commonly known as malware, encompasses various types designed to harm or exploit computer systems. Beyond viruses and trojans, other prevalent forms include:

- **Worms**: Self-replicating programs that spread across networks without user intervention, often exploiting vulnerabilities to propagate. 

- **Spyware**: Software that covertly gathers user information without consent, monitoring activities and collecting sensitive data. 

- **Adware**: Programs that automatically display or download advertisements, typically bundled with free software and often intrusive. 

- **Ransomware**: Malware that encrypts a user's files or locks them out of their system, demanding payment to restore access. 

- **Rootkits**: Tools that enable unauthorized users to gain control over a system without detection, often hiding other malicious activities. 

- **Bots/Botnets**: Networks of infected computers controlled remotely, often used to conduct large-scale attacks or distribute spam. 

- **Fileless Malware**: Malicious code that operates in memory rather than installing files, making it harder to detect and remove. 

Understanding these malware types is crucial for implementing effective cybersecurity measures.
